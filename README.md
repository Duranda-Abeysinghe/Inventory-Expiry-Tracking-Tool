# Inventory-Expiry-Tracking-Tool
The Inventory Expiry Tracker Tool helps manage products by tracking expiry dates, sorting items using a Min Heap, and managing stock with a FIFO Queue. It compares dates to flag expired or near-expiry items and sends timely alerts. This reduces wastage, saves money, and improves inventory efficiency.
